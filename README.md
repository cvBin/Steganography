# Steganography-and-Encryption-System
Parasite Steganography and Encryption System is an image-based message/data steganography and encryption software which integrates the advanced technologies of computer vision, image processing and data encryption. Parasite takes ordinary image as message carrier, and can automatically conceal message of any format into an image and meanwhile encrypt it with a randomly-generated unique dictionary in form of binary data stream. Through the independently-designed unique algorithm, a piece of message is embedded into an image and encrypted quietly without any changing in visual effect. With Parasite steganography and encryption software and by just sending an ordinary daily selfie, you can secretly, safely and securely transmit any message to any corner of the world through network.
